This is a description of the issue of my choice and a discussion of the background

1. Issue
Business decision to be made: To recommend a location for a client planning to open a coffee and whisky bar that sells coffee and light meal in day time, and specialty whisky and cocktail bar serving bar food in the evenings

City of choice: Hong Kong

2. Background
- The client would like to maximise the use of the shop and decide to have a food and beverage shop that could attract two groups of diners at different time of the day. 

- Consideration of the shop location

  a. Near prime office location
  
     To attract office workers who need a decent caffeine boost, or businesspeople needing a place for mingling/informal meeting during the day.

     Prime office location would also imply a potential source of middle-income white collars will be around the shop, whom would be willing to pay a premium for the orders to    compensate the high rental costs borne by the shop.

   b. Availability of public transport
   
     This would bring extra convenience to the people to go home after a drink or two in the evenings, driving after getting drunk would not be wise after all.

    c. Competitions around
    
     Would need to know the number of coffee shops and bars around, as well as a snapshot of the reviews of shops in close proximity.
